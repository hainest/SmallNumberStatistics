; NAME:
;       BINOMIAL_LIMITS
;
; AUTHOR:
;       Tim Haines, tdhq36@mail.umkc.edu
;
; PURPOSE:
;       This function computes the single-sided upper and lower
;		confidence limits for the binomial distribution.
;
; CATEGORY:
;       Statistics and probability
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;       P = BINOMIAL_LIMITS(NSUCCESS, NTOTAL, [CL [,/SIGMA]])
;
; INPUTS:
;       NSUCCESS:	A strictly nonnegative integer that specifies the
;               	number of successes in NTOTAL Bernoulli trials. Can
;                   be an array.
;       
;       NTOTAL:		An integer strictly greater than NSUCCESS that
;               	specifies the number of Bernoulli trials. Can be
;                   an array.
;        
; OPTIONAL INPUTS:
;       CL:     The confidence level in the interval [0, 1]. The default
;               is 0.8413 (i.e., 1 sigma)
;
;       SIGMA:  If this keyword is set, then CL is assumed to be a
;               multiple of sigma, and the actual confidence level
;               is computed from the standard normal distribution with
;               parameter CL.
;
; RETURNS:
;       A two-dimensional array such that the array P[*,0] contains the upper
;       single-sided confidence limits, and the array P[*,1] contains the lower
;       single-sided confidence limits.

;       N. Gehrels. Confidence limits for small numbers of events in astrophysical
;       data. The Astrophysical Journal, 303:336â€“346, April 1986.
;
; EXAMPLE:
;       I have a mass bin with 100 galaxies (20 reds and 80 blues)
;       and I am computing the fraction of reds to blues, then for this
;       bin NSUCCESS = 20 and NTOTAL = 100.
;
;       To compute the confidence limits at the 2.5 sigma level, use
;
;           p = binomial_limits(20, 100, 2.5, /sigma)
;               p = [ [0.31756], [0.11056] ]
;
;       Since these are the confidence limits, the fraction would be
;       reported as
;
;           0.2 (+0.11756, -0.08944)
