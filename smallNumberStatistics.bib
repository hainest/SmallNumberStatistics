	abstract = {We present improved numerical approximations to the exact Poissonian confidence limits for small numbers n of observed events following the approach of Gehrels. Analytic descriptions of all parameters used in the approximations are provided to allow their straightforward inclusion in computer algorithms for processing of large data sets. Our estimates of the upper (lower) Poisson confidence limits are accurate to better than 1 per cent for n{\textless}= 100 and values of S, the derived significance in units of Gaussian standard deviations, of up to 7 (5). In view of the slow convergence of the commonly used Gaussian approximations towards the correct Poissonian values, in particular for higher values of S, we argue that, for n{\textless}= 40, Poissonian statistics should be used in most applications, unless errors of the order of, or exceeding, 10 per cent are acceptable.},

	abstract = {Applying the standard weighted mean formula, {[SUM\_i} n\_isigma{\textasciicircum}-2\_i] / 
{[SUM\_i} sigma{\textasciicircum}-2\_i], to determine the weighted mean of data, n\_i, drawn 
from a Poisson distribution, will, on average, underestimate the true 
mean by {\textasciitilde}1 for all true mean values larger than {\textasciitilde}3 when the common 
assumption is made that the error of the ith observation is 
sigma\_i=max(sqrt(n\_i), 1). This small, but statistically significant 
offset, explains the long-known observation that chi-square minimization 
techniques which use the modified Neyman's chi{\textasciicircum}2 statistic, {chi{\textasciicircum}2\_N=} 
{SUM\_i} (n\_i-y\_i){\textasciicircum}2/max(n\_i,1), to compare Poisson-distributed data with 
model values, y\_i, will typically predict a total number of counts that 
underestimates the true total by about 1 count per bin. Based on my 
finding that the weighted mean of data drawn from a Poisson distribution 
can be determined using the formula {[SUM\_i} [n\_i+min(n\_i, 1)](n\_i + 
1){\textasciicircum}-1] / {[SUM\_i} (n\_i + 1){\textasciicircum}-1], I propose that a new chi{\textasciicircum}2 statistic, 
chi{\textasciicircum}2\_gamma= {SUM\_i} [n\_i+min(n\_i, 1) - y\_i]{\textasciicircum}2 / [n\_i + 1], should always 
be used to analyze Poisson-distributed data in preference to the 
modified Neyman's chi{\textasciicircum}2 statistic. I demonstrate the power and 
usefulness of chi{\textasciicircum}2\_gamma minimization by using two statistical fitting 
techniques and five chi{\textasciicircum}2 statistics to analyze simulated X-ray 
power-law 15 channel spectra with large and small counts per bin. I show 
that chi{\textasciicircum}2\_gamma minimization with the Levenberg-Marquardt or Powell's 
method can produce excellent results (mean slope errors {\textless}{\textasciitilde}3\%) with 
spectra having as few as 25 total counts.},

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007physics...2156C},
	abstract = {Hypothesis tests for the presence of new sources of Poisson counts 
amidst background processes are frequently performed in high energy 
physics {(HEP)}, gamma ray astronomy {(GRA)}, and other branches of science. 
While there are conceptual issues already when the mean rate of 
background is precisely known, the issues are even more difficult when 
the mean background rate has non-negligible uncertainty. After 
describing a variety of methods to be found in the {HEP} and {GRA} 
literature, we consider in detail three classes of algorithms and 
evaluate them over a wide range of parameter space, by the criterion of 
how close the ensemble-average Type I error rate (rejection of the 
background-only hypothesis when it is true) compares with the nominal 
significance level given by the algorithm. We recommend wider use of an 
algorithm firmly grounded in frequentist tests of the ratio of Poisson 
means, although for very low counts the over-coverage can be severe due 
to the effect of discreteness. We extend the studies of Cranmer, who 
found that a popular Bayesian-frequentist hybrid can undercover severely 
when taken to high Z values. We also examine the profile likelihood 
method, which has long been used in {GRA} and {HEP;} it provides an 
excellent approximation in much of the parameter space, as previously 
studied by Rolke and collaborators.},

	abstract = {I present a critical review of techniques for estimating confidence intervals on binomial population proportions inferred from success counts in small to intermediate samples. Population proportions arise frequently as quantities of interest in astronomical research; for instance, in studies aiming to constrain the bar fraction, active galactic nucleus fraction, supermassive black hole fraction, merger fraction, or red sequence fraction from counts of galaxies exhibiting distinct morphological features or stellar populations. However, two of the most widely-used techniques for estimating binomial confidence intervals - the `normal approximation' and the Clopper \& Pearson approach - are liable to misrepresent the degree of statistical uncertainty present under sampling conditions routinely encountered in astronomical surveys, leading to an ineffective use of the experimental data (and, worse, an inefficient use of the resources expended in obtaining that data). Hence, I provide here an overview of the fundamentals of binomial statistics with two principal aims: (i) to reveal the ease with which {(Bayesian)} binomial confidence intervals with more satisfactory behaviour may be estimated from the quantiles of the beta distribution using modern mathematical software packages (e.g. r, matlab, mathematica, idl, python); and (ii) to demonstrate convincingly the major flaws of both the `normal approximation' and the Clopper \& Pearson approach for error estimation.},
