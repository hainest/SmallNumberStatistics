 NAME:
       binomialLimits

 AUTHOR:
       Tim Haines, tdhq36@mail.umkc.edu

 PURPOSE:
       This function computes the single-sided upper and lower
       confidence limits for the binomial distribution.

 CATEGORY:
       Statistics and probability

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
       (u,l) = binomialLimits(nsuccess, ntotal, [, cl [, sigma]])

 INPUTS:
       nsuccess:   A strictly nonnegative integer that specifies the
                   number of successes in ntotal Bernoulli trials.
                   Can be a list or a numpy array.
       
       ntotal:     An integer strictly greater than nsuccess that
                   specifies the number of Bernoulli trials.
                   Can be a list or a numpy array.

 OPTIONAL INPUTS:
       cl:     The confidence level in the interval [0, 1]. The default
               is 0.8413 (i.e., 1 sigma)

 OPTIONS:
       sigma:  If this is true, then cl is assumed to be a
               multiple of sigma, and the actual confidence level
               is computed from the standard normal distribution with
               parameter cl.

 RETURNS:
        Two lists: the first containing the upper limits, and the second
        containing the lower limits. If the inputs are numpy arrays, then
        numpy arrays are returned instead of lists. If the inputs are scalars,
        then scalars are returned.

       N. Gehrels. Confidence limits for small numbers of events in astrophysical
       data. The Astrophysical Journal, 303:336-346, April 1986.

 EXAMPLE:
       I have a mass bin with 100 galaxies (20 reds and 80 blues)
       and I am computing the fraction of reds to blues, then for this
       bin NSUCCESS = 20 and NTOTAL = 100.

       To compute the confidence limits at the 2.5 sigma level, use

           (u,l) = binomialLimits(20, 100, 2.5, sigma=True)
               u = 0.31756
               l = 0.11056

       Since these are the confidence limits, the fraction would be
       reported as

           0.2 (+0.11756, -0.08944)

 EXAMPLE:
       Compute the confidence limits of seeing 20 events in 8
       seconds at the 2.5 sigma.

       However, recall that the Poisson parameter is defined as the
       average rate, so it is necessary to divide these values by
       the time (or space) interval over which they were observed.

       Since these are the confidence limits, the fraction would be
       reported as
